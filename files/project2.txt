Our collars look like blooming cherries
Blossoms fall when a storm hits Yoshino
Born as sons of Yamato we are prepared
To fall like flowers in a skirmish line
 
Rifles a few feet long are not weapons
Blades a few inches long are of no use
Everyone knows that for two millennia
We have developed the spirit of Yamato
 
Warriors trusted to guard the colors
We amount to two hundred thousand strong
Garrisoned at more than eighty places
Never thinking of letting our guard down
